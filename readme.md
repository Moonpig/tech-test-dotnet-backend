# Moonpig Engineering recruitment test

Welcome to the Moonpig engineering test. Here at Moonpig we really value
quality code, and this test has been designed to allow you to show us how 
you think quality code should be written. 

To allow you to focus on the design and implementation of the code we have 
added all the use cases we expect you to implement to the bottom of the 
instructions. In return we ask that you make sure your implementation 
follows all the best practices you are aware of, and that at the end of it, 
the code you submit, is code you are proud of. 

We have not set a time limit, we prefer that you spend some extra time to get
it right and write the highest quality code you can. Please feel free to make
any changes you want to the solution, add classes, remove projects etc.

We are interested in seeing how you approach the task so please commit more
regularly than you normally would so we can see each step and **include
the .git folder in your submission**.

When complete please upload your solution and answers in a .zip to the google
drive link provided to you by the recruiter.

## Programming Exercise - Moonpig Post Office

You have been tasked with creating a service that calculates the estimated 
despatch dates of customers' orders. 

An order consists of an order date and a collection of products that a 
customer has added to their shopping basket. 

Each of these products is supplied to Moonpig on demand through a number of 
3rd party suppliers.

As soon as an order is received by a supplier, the supplier will start 
processing the order. The supplier has an agreed lead time in which to 
process the order before delivering it to the Moonpig Post Office.

Once the Moonpig Post Office has received all products in an order it is 
despatched to the customer.

**Assumptions**:

1. Suppliers start processing an order on the same day that the order is 
	received. For example, a supplier with a lead time of one day, receiving
	an order today will send it to Moonpig tomorrow.

2. For the purposes of this exercise we are ignoring time i.e. if a 
	supplier has a lead time of 1 day then an order received any time on 
	Tuesday would arrive at Moonpig on the Wednesday.

3. Once all products for an order have arrived at Moonpig from the suppliers,
	they will be despatched to the customer on the same day.

### Part 1 

When the /api/DespatchDate endpoint is hit return the despatch date of that
order.

### Part 2

Moonpig Post Office staff are getting complaints from customers expecting
packages to be delivered on the weekend. You find out that the Moonpig post
office is shut over the weekend. Packages received from a supplier on a
weekend will be despatched the following Monday.

Modify the existing code to ensure that any orders received from a supplier
on the weekend are despatched on the following Monday.

### Part 3

The Moonpig post office is still getting complaints... It turns out suppliers
don't work during the weekend as well, i.e. if an order is received on the
Friday with a lead time of 2 days, Moonpig would receive and despatch on the
Tuesday.

Modify the existing code to ensure that any orders that would have been 
processed during the weekend resume processing on Monday.

---

Parts 1 & 2 have already been completed albeit lacking in quality. Please
review the code, document the problems you find (see question 1), and refactor
into what you would consider quality code.

Once you have completed the refactoring, extend your solution to capture the 
requirements listed in part 3.

Please note, the provided DbContext is a stubbed class which provides test 
data. Please feel free to use this in your implementation and tests but do 
keep in mind that it would be switched for something like an EntityFramework 
DBContext backed by a real database in production.

While completing the exercise please answer the questions listed below. 
We are not looking for essay length answers. You can add the answers in this 
document.

## Questions

Q1. What 'code smells' / anti-patterns did you find in the existing 
	implementation of part 1 & 2?

	- Two of the five unit tests failed, this was because a dynamic date was being used 'DateTime.Now' causing the despatch date to fall on a weekend
	  which the code then adjusts to a weekend day. The unit tests were refactored to use fixed dates.

	- The '_mlt' variable was changed from 'public' to 'private' to limit the scope following best practice. '_' prefixed variables are naming conventions used
	  for private variables.

	- variables '_mlt', 's' and 'lt' have been renamed too '_maxLeadTime', 'supplierId' and 'leadTime' to accurately reflect what the variable holds following 
	  best practice.

	- implicitly typed variables 'var' replaced with explicit types 'int' and 'DespatchDate' in the API controller and the unit tests.

	- space entered between foreach loop and if statement in the despatchdate controller

	- if, else statement is missing curly braces for the else section. These have been added.

	- 'using' imports changed to reference the full namespaces of the functionality being imported in the unit tests and the controller.

	- Missing unit test for the supplier with the longest lead time used acceptance criteria, this has been added.

Q2. What best practices have you used while implementing your solution?

   - variables renamed to accurately reflect what the variable holds.

   - implicitly typed variables 'var' replaced with explicit types 'int' and 'DespatchDate' in the API controller and the unit tests.

   - if, else statement is missing curly braces for the else section.  These have been added.

   - '_' prefix naming convention indicating a private variable.

   - variable scope limited (public changed to private in the case of '_mlt').

   - 'using' imports changed to reference the full namespaces.

   - wrote the unit tests first following the TDD approach

   - ensured all the acceptance criteria was reflected in the unit tests.


Q3. What further steps would you take to improve the solution given more time?

   - implement try, catch blocks in the code to ensure any exceptions are caught and accurate error messages are returned to the caller.
   
   - Given more time I would return accurate httpstatuscodes to ensure missing data returns a 404 and any exceptions return the correct error not a generic 
     500 bad request.

   - implement error logging so any errors are logged in the database to be looked at and root causes diagnosed.

   - implemented entity framework and implemented a sql server database with stored the data the API uses.
  

Q4. What's a technology that you're excited about and where do you see this 
    being applicable? (Your answer does not have to be related to this problem)

   - GraphQL excites me with the possibilities this can offer

   - picking up node.js a new server side runtime interests me.

   - exploring AWS and understanding the similarities and differences to Azure interests me

   - Making better use of message brokers with message queues is interesting too, I've had some exposure with Azure Service Bus but would like to explore this further.
